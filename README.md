## 🚀 2. Quickstart & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **MongoDB**: v6.0+ running on `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install root, backend, and frontend packages
npm install
npm --prefix server install
npm --prefix client install
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
Create `.env` inside `server/`:
```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```
Default configuration:
```env
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/job_portal
JWT_SECRET=smart_job_portal_super_secret_jwt_key_2026
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
*(If SMTP credentials are not supplied, transactional emails are automatically logged to the terminal via the simulation transport without crashing).*

### Step 3: Seed the Database
Populates the database with **2 verified companies**, **5 active job vacancies**, and **10 candidate profiles** with pre-computed smart match scores:
```bash
npm run seed
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server
Starts the Express API on port `5001` and Vite frontend on `http://localhost:5173`:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 3. Running Automated Tests

Run the full Jest & Supertest test suite (all 31 unit & integration tests):
```bash
npm test
```
The test suite covers:
- **Auth**: password complexity validation, corporate email blocklist, JWT signing, password comparison.
- **Profile**: subdocument CRUD, case-insensitive skill deduplication, duplicate project prevention.
- **Jobs & Mandatory Requirements**: mandatory field computation, blocking candidates lacking experience/GitHub.
- **Duplicate Prevention Rules**: same user/job duplicate block, multi-apply to different jobs, duplicate resume file hash block, duplicate profile fingerprint block, and parallel concurrent apply requests.
- **Review & Notifications**: auto-shortlist by threshold, interview calls, rejection improvement reasons, and company ownership security.

## 📋 5. Step-by-Step Demo Walkthrough

### 5.1 Multi-Apply Validation
1. Sign in as **Arun Kumar** (`arun@example.com` / `Password123`).
2. Navigate to **Explore Jobs**.
3. Apply to **"Senior Full Stack MERN Developer"** using your PDF resume &rarr; Application created with 85%+ score.
4. Navigate back to **Explore Jobs** and click **"Junior Software Engineer"** &rarr; Notice that Arun can apply to multiple different job openings without restriction.

### 5.2 Duplicate Prevention Enforcement
1. While logged in as Arun, try to apply again to **"Senior Full Stack MERN Developer"**.
   - Result: Form displays "✓ Applied" and backend blocks the request with **HTTP 409: Duplicate application blocked**.
2. Register a new account (`copycat@testmail.com`) and try to submit the exact same resume PDF file to that same job.
   - Result: Blocked with **HTTP 409: Duplicate resume checksum detected**.
3. Register another account using Arun's same GitHub URL (`https://github.com/arunkumar-dev`).
   - Result: Blocked with **HTTP 409: Duplicate candidate profile fingerprint detected**.

### 5.3 Mandatory Field Enforcement
1. Create a fresh candidate account with 0 years of experience.
2. View **"Senior Full Stack MERN Developer"** (which mandates 2+ years of experience and GitHub).
3. Try to apply &rarr; Request is blocked with **HTTP 400: Mandatory requirements not satisfied (requires 2 years experience and GitHub URL)**.

### 5.4 Match Score & Ordered Improvement Suggestions
1. As Arun, open the job details for **"DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure Engineer"**.
2. View the **Smart Match Breakdown** &rarr; displays point allocations across Required Skills (35), Preferred (10), Projects (15), Experience (10), Hackathons (8), and Academics (5).
3. Inspect the **Areas to Improve** list &rarr; suggestions are strictly sorted by points gained in descending order (e.g. `+14 pts` for AWS/Kubernetes proficiency, `+3 pts` for hackathon rankings).

### 5.5 Company Review & Shortlist Interview Call
1. Sign in as **TechCorp** (`recruiting@techcorp.io` / `Password123`).
2. Open **Employer Dashboard** and click **Review Ranked Applicants** on the MERN opening.
3. Applicants are automatically sorted with the highest match score at the top.
4. Click **Update Status / Schedule** on a candidate &rarr; select **Schedule Interview**, enter Date/Time/Google Meet link, and submit.
5. Sign in as that candidate &rarr; check **Alerts (Navbar notification pill)** and **My Applications** to review the official interview call.

### 5.6 Automated Threshold Shortlist & Rejection Feedback
1. On the Company Applicants page, click **⚡ Auto-Shortlist by Score Threshold**.
2. Enter score threshold `75`, check *"Also automatically reject applicants below threshold"*, and click **Run Auto-Shortlist**.
3. Candidates with score &ge; 75% are instantly shortlisted with interview invitations; candidates below 75% receive rejection notices with auto-generated improvement areas.

## ⚖️ 6. Assumptions & Architectural Decisions

1. **Company vs Platform Admin**: The brief noted *"the Admin page in my notes: a company account that manages its own jobs and applicants. Company accounts and seeker accounts are separate. Nobody can self-register as a platform admin."* Therefore, Company accounts possess administrative powers over their own job vacancies, applicant pipelines, and interview schedules, strictly isolated by tenant company ID.
2. **Mandatory Fields Computation**: A Mongoose pre-save hook on the Job model dynamically inspects all filled constraint fields (skills, experience, CGPA, GitHub, LinkedIn, projects) and persists a `mandatoryFields` array enforced on the apply route.
3. **Email Resilience**: Email dispatch uses asynchronous execution with comprehensive try/catch guards. In environments without SMTP keys, transactional emails gracefully fall back to formatted console logging so no API call ever crashes due to third-party mailer timeouts.

## ☁️ 7. GitHub Setup & Cloud Deployment

### 7.1 Push to GitHub
```bash
# Option 1: Via GitHub CLI
gh auth login -w
gh repo create job-portal --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Option 2: Standard Git
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/job-portal.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 7.2 Deploy to Render (1-Click Full Stack)
1. Sign up on [Render.com](https://render.com).
2. Create **New + → Blueprint** and connect your GitHub repository.
3. Render automatically picks up `render.yaml` to build and serve both the API and Vite React frontend from a single web service.
4. Add your **MongoDB Atlas** connection string as `MONGO_URI`.

### 7.3 Docker Container Deployment
```bash
docker build -t smart-job-portal .
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 -e MONGO_URI="<your-mongodb-atlas-uri>" -e JWT_SECRET="<secret>" smart-job-portal
```
